Extended Deck Construction

Note: As of October 7, 2013, Wizards of the Coast no longer recognizes Extended as a sanctionable format. Tournament organizers may no longer sanction Extended events and Extended is no longer supported on Magic Online. For more information, please see this announcement.

Constructed decks must contain a minimum of sixty cards. There is no maximum deck size; however, you must be able to shuffle your deck with no assistance. If a player wishes to use a sideboard, it must have fifteen or fewer cards.

With the exception of basic land cards, a playerâ€™s combined deck and sideboard may not contain more than four of any individual card, counted by its English card title equivalent. All cards named Plains, Island, Swamp, Mountain, and Forest are basic.

The following card sets are permitted in Extended tournaments:

Scars of Mirrodin
