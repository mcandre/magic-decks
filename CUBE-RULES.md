Cube Draft

Cube Draft encompasses many of the most enjoyable aspects of Magic: The Gathering, combining elements of both Constructed and Limited play, trading, and playing the game with friends. To prepare for this format, a player (or, if you prefer, your entire play group) prepares a "cube"â€”a specifically selected set of at least 360 different Magic cards. Many cubes contain upwards of 720 cards to provide more variety among drafts.

Once the cube has been built, you can use it for any draft format. The most popular option is to build makeshift "booster packs" out of 15 randomly selected cards from the cube and then run a regular Booster Draft. But you can also use your cube for Winston Draft, Solomon Draft, or any other kind of draft format.

Building a cube is a great way to get some extra play value out of your favorite cards, or even out of cards that haven't found a home in your Constructed decks. The best aspect of it is how personalized it is. Every cube is different, and you can build the pool of cards you'll draft with however you choose. Ever wondered what drafting with only artifacts would be like? Build your cube out of just artifacts! Ever wanted to draft only red cards, or use only cards that weren't legal in Standard tournaments? The cube allows you to set up just such an experience and share it with friends. Some players even create intricate lists of the most powerful Magic cards ever created and try to include each one in their cube. What will your cube look like? That's up to you to decide!
