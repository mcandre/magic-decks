Freeform

Freeform is a casual Magic Online format that allows all sets and cards. Regular deckbuilding rules are relaxed; decks can contain any number of copies of a card; multiple Vanguard cards may be included. The only restriction is a 40-card minimum deck.

There are no cards banned in Freeform. You can even play the promotional Gleemox card (despite it saying that it's banned)!
