Two-Headed Giant Constructed Format Deck Construction

Two-Headed Giant Constructed decks must contain a minimum of sixty cards. There is no maximum deck size; however, you must be able to shuffle your deck with no assistance.

Two-Headed Giant uses the Unified Deck Construction rules. With the exception of basic land cards, a team's combined decks may not contain more than four of any individual card, counted by its English card title. (For example, if one player is using four Naturalizes in a Multiplayer Constructed event, no other player on that team may have a Naturalize in his or her deck.) Sideboards are not allowed in Constructed Multiplayer tournaments.

If a card is restricted in a particular format, no more than one of that card may be used by the team. No players may use cards that are banned in a particular format.

In addition to the above rules, the following card is banned in Constructed Two-Headed Giant tournaments:

Erayo, Soratami Ascendant
