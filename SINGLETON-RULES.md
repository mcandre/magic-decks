Singleton

In the Singleton format, no two cards in a player's deck can share a name unless they're basic lands (Plains, Islands, Swamps, Mountains, and Forests). Players can use Standard, Extended, Legacy, or Vintage deckbuilding rules. Building a deck that works consistently yet contains no duplicates can be a creative challenge, or it can be the perfect format to take advantage of a small card collection that might not have multiple copies of rare cards. Singleton decks lead to games that are more varied, more interesting (as you see cards you may not normally see), and—maybe—more fun!
