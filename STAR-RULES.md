Star (also known as Pentagram or Five-Point)

Ever wonder what would happen if the five colors of Magic sat down to do battle with one another? The Star format is your chance to find out! In Star, five players each represent one of the five colors of Magic (white, blue, black, red, and green) by playing a deck featuring only cards of that color. Decks may not include any cards that reference a different color or a basic land that produces a different color of mana.

Players sit in a star pattern identical to the one on the back of every Magic: The Gathering card. The player with the white deck takes the first turn and then play continues clockwise around the table.

-> W -> U -> B -> R -> G ->

A color, and the player representing it, wins when its two enemy colors have been eliminated regardless of who eliminated them. This means a player may be able to win even after being eliminated from play! Each player can attack any other player (even their allies), and each player can target any player, permanent, spell, or anything else in the game. Decks are usually built following Standard deck-construction rules, but players can determine for themselves if they'd rather use Extended, Legacy, Vintage, or any other format.

Star is the perfect variant for any group of players who has ever argued over which color in Magic is the best. Get your friends together and battle to find out. Then when the game is over, reset and find out if the winner can hold up a second time!
