PAUPER FORMAT

In this Magic Online format, all cards must have been printed at common rarity in a Magic Online set or product. Common promo cards are only legal if the card meets that qualification.

If a common version of a particular card was ever released on Magic Online, any version of that card is legal in this format.

Example: Counterspell was a common card in Core Set Seventh Edition online. Counterspell was reprinted in Masters Edition II with an uncommon expansion symbol. Both versions of the card can now be used in pauper.

Other than that, the usual rules for constructed decks apply:

Minimum of sixty cards
No maximum deck size, as long as you can shuffle your deck unassisted
Up to fifteen cards in your sideboard, if used
No more than four of any individual card in the main deck and sideboard combined (with the exception of basic lands)

BANNED CARDS

The following cards are banned in this format:

Cloudpost
Cranial Plating
Empty the Warrens
Frantic Search
Grapeshot
Invigorate
Temporal Fissure
